# Homework Task

**Write Github actions for unit testing and linting for any of the existing solutions of Homeworks 2 or 3, document the process of writing github actions in the documentation**

---

For this you have to complete the following steps:

- Discuss in this repository using issus which homework project you want to implement
- Check if the license allows it
- Discuss with the other groups using issues which homework project they implement. Each group should implement a different one.
- Discuss in this repository using issues who will do which task (developing github action, documentation, unit test and linting code)
- Discuss who should be the main responsible for the repository (the one that can accept merge requests, let me know in discord so I can adjust rights)
- Discuss and generate milestone for your project to optimize the timeline of your project
- Discuss and generate labels for your issues
- Fork this repository
- Merge the necessary fies from the original homework project into your fork
- commit
- create merge requests for your work

Also use discord for discussing solutions to any issues popping up.

## Tasks for algortihm, documentation, unit test

- algorithm: focus on the github action implementation, but also adapt the old code to make it work
- documentation: focus on the github action idocumentation, but also document what had to be changed, generate a list with all the items that had to be changed in the old code to adapt it to the github actions (see changelog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog)
- unit test: focus on providing a seperate function / module (based on the old code - report to documentation developer what changes are needed) to the algorithm developer, so it can be implemented as a github action
